Week 1 Project:
Part 1: From the dataset above, write Python code to answer the following questions:

1. Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv")
clear_weather_df = df[df['Weather'] == 'Clear']

print(clear_weather_df)





2. Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr. - 474 times

import pandas as pd

# The line defines the Path to the CSV file
csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv"


df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)


# The line filters the DataFrame to find all records where the wind speed is 4 km/hr
wind_speed_4_df = df[df['Wind Speed_km/h'] == 4]

# The number of such records are counted.
count_wind_speed_4 = wind_speed_4_df.shape[0]

# Display count
print(f"The wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr {count_wind_speed_4} times.")





3. Check if there are any NULL values present in the dataset. - The dataset does not contain NULL values.
import pandas as pd
def check_null_values(csv_file_path):
    

    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    
    # The line checks for NULL values in the DataFrame
    has_null_values = df.isnull().values.any()
    
    return has_null_values


csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv" 
if check_null_values(csv_file_path):
    print("The dataset contains NULL values.")
else:
    print("The dataset does not contain NULL values.")




4. Rename the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition." 
import pandas as pd


def rename_column(csv_file_path):
   
   
   df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)

   
   df.rename(columns={'Weather': 'Weather_Condition'}, inplace=True)
    
   return df


csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv"  
df_renamed = rename_column(csv_file_path)

# The line displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to verify the change
print(df_renamed.head())





5. What is the mean visibility of the dataset? - The mean visibility is: 27.664446721311478 km
import pandas as pd

def mean_visibility(csv_file_path):
    
    
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    
    # The line calculates the mean of the visibility in the visibility column
    mean_visibility_value = df['Visibility_km'].mean()
    
    return mean_visibility_value


csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv"  # Replace with your actual CSV file path
mean_visibility_value = mean_visibility(csv_file_path)
print(f"The mean visibility is: {mean_visibility_value} km")





6. Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km. - 308 records
import pandas as pd
def count_records(csv_file_path):
    

    
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    
    # The line filters the DataFrame based on the conditions given.
    filtered_df = df[(df['Wind Speed_km/h'] > 24) & (df['Visibility_km'] == 25)]
    
    # The line counts the number of records meeting the conditions
    record_count = filtered_df.shape[0]
    
    return record_count


csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv"
record_count = count_records(csv_file_path)
print(f"The number of records with wind speed > 24 km/hr and visibility = 25 km is: {record_count}")





7. What is the mean value of each column for each weather condition?
import pandas as pd

def mean_values_by_weather_condition(csv_file_path):
      

    
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    
    # The line selects only numeric columns is the dataset
    numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
    
    # The line groups by the 'Weather' column and calculates the mean for each group
    mean_values = numeric_df.groupby(df['Weather']).mean()
    
    return mean_values


csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv"
mean_values = mean_values_by_weather_condition(csv_file_path)
print(mean_values)





8. Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.

import pandas as pd

def find_clear_weather_instances(csv_file_path):


    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    
    # The line prints the columns in the DataFrame for debugging
    print("Columns in the DataFrame:", df.columns.tolist())

    # The line filters the DataFrame based on the conditions
    filtered_df = df[
        (df['Weather'] == 'Clear') &
        ((df['Rel Hum_%'] > 50) | (df['Visibility_km'] > 40))
    ]
    
    return filtered_df
    

csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv" 
filtered_data = find_clear_weather_instances(csv_file_path)
print(filtered_data)





9. Find the number of weather conditions that include snow. - The number of weather conditions that include 'snow' is: 66
import pandas as pd

def count_snow_conditions(csv_file_path):


    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)
    print("Columns in the DataFrame:", df.columns.tolist())
    
    # The line ensures the 'Weather' column is in the DataFrame
    if 'Weather' not in df.columns:
        raise ValueError("The 'Weather' column is not present in the DataFrame")
    
    # The line converts the 'Weather' column to string to handle any non-string values
    df['Weather'] = df['Weather'].astype(str)
    
    # The line filters the DataFrame for weather conditions containing the term 'snow'
    snow_conditions = df[df['Weather'].str.contains('Snow Showers', case=False, na=False)]
    
    # The line finds weather conditions that include 'snow'
    snow_conditions = snow_conditions['Weather']
    
    # The line counts the number of snow conditions
    num_unique_snow_conditions = len(snow_conditions)
    
    return num_unique_snow_conditions


csv_file_path = r"C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Lux Academy DS work\1. Weather data.csv"
num_snow_conditions = count_snow_conditions(csv_file_path)
print(f"The number of weather conditions that include 'snow' is: {num_snow_conditions}")





Part 2: Move this CSV into a database of your choice and use SQL to answer 4 of the questions above.
